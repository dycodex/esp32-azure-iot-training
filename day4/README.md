# Day 4

As stated in the syllabus, the 4th day is focused on the features of Azure IoT Hub such as cloud-to-device messaging, device twins, and direct method invocation.

#### Important Notice

You will need to copy the `esp-azure` directory from the `day3/finished/esp32_azure_iot_hub/components` directory to the `components` directory of each projects under `day4` directory.

The reason for that is the `esp-azure` component's size is large, and we can't link the original repository as git submodule yet.
